# vibehtml

A personal scratchpad for vibecoding one-off HTML pages and tiny UI experiments.
Published to GitHub Pages so I can access them anywhere.

## What this is

- A lightweight place to build single-purpose HTML pages
- Minimal setup, no framework assumptions
- Designed for quick experiments and throwaway ideas

## How it works

- Each page is a standalone HTML file
- Open files locally in a browser, or use the GitHub Pages URL
- No build step required
- `index.html` is the landing page for the repo

## Pages

- `run-calculator/` - interval run distance and time calculator

## Publishing

This repo is intended to be served via GitHub Pages.
Once enabled, the site will be available at the GitHub Pages URL for the repo.

## Notes

- This is a personal playground; stability and API guarantees are not a goal
- Add any new pages at the repo root or in folders as needed
